# Retrospective

## Stop Doing
- I ran out of time and tried doing the unit test and I think I almost got it but I had no more time so to make it pass I removed the failing tests. I hope I can go over them later with a coach because they are important!


## Continue Doing
- I had 2 good coach sessions and I should have had probably 1 more.
- My main priority in this project has been to show what I can do and what I cannot do.
- I think around 75% I could handle on my own (mostly planning) and with help I could manage to figure out the problems

## Start Doing
- More coding practise

## Lessons Learned
- Be ready for last minute incidents, the storm disrupted my Friday where I was supposed to finish my project, but lost most of the day as I had to have my son home.

## Strategy vs. Board

### What parts of your plan went as expected?

### What parts of your plan did not work out?

### Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?

### Or remove extra steps?
